  <shortDescription>
    Learns a random forest for classification.
  </shortDescription>

  <fullDescription>
    <intro>
      <p>
        Learns a random forest, which consists of a chosen number of decision trees. Each of the decision tree models is
        learned on a different set of rows (records) and a different set of columns (describing attributes), whereby 
        the latter can also be a bit-vector or byte-vector descriptor (e.g. molecular fingerprint).
        The row sets for each decision tree are created by bootstrapping and have the same size as the original input table.
        For each node of a decision tree a new set of attributes is determined by taking a random sample of size sqrt(m) where
        m is the total number of attributes.
         The output model describes 
        a random forest and is applied in the corresponding predictor node.

      	This node provides a subset of the functionality of the <i>Tree Ensemble Learner</i> corresponding to a random forest.
      	If you need additional functionality please check out the <i>Tree Ensemble Learner</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Experiments have shown the results on different datasets are very similar to the 
        <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/">Random forest implementation available in R</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision tree construction takes place in main memory (all data and all models are kept in memory).
      </p>
      <p>
      	The missing value handling corresponds to the method described <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/21">here</a>.
      	The basic idea is that for each split to try to send the missing values in every possible direction; the one yielding the best results (i.e. largest gain)
      	is then used. If no missing values are present during training, the direction of the split that the most records are following is chosen as
      	the direction for missing values during testing.
      </p>
       <p>
      	Nominal columns are split in a binary manner. The determination of the split depends on the kind of problem:
      	<ul>
      		<li>For two-class classification problems the method described in section 9.4 of "Classification and Regression Trees" by Breiman et al. (1984) is used.</li>
      		<li>For multi-class classification problems the method described in "Partitioning Nominal Attributes in Decision Trees" by Coppersmith et al. (1999) is used.</li>
      	</ul>
      </p>
    </intro>
    <tab name="Options">
      <option name="Target Column">
        Select the column containing the value to be learned. Rows with missing values in this column are ignored
        during the learning process.
      </option>
      <option name="Attribute Selection">
		<p>Select the attributes on which the model should be learned. You can choose from two modes.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Fingerprint attribute</i>
			Uses a fingerprint/vector (bit, byte, and double are possible) column to learn the model by treating
			each entry of the vector as separate attributes (e.g. a bit vector of length 1024 is expanded into 1024 binary attributes).
			The node requires all vectors to be of the same length.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Column attributes</i>
			Uses ordinary columns in your table (e.g. String, Double, Integer, etc.) as attributes to learn the model on.
			The dialog allows you to select the columns manually (by moving them to the right panel) or via a wildcard/regex selection
			(all columns whose names match the wildcard/regex are used for learning).
			In case of manual selection, the behavior for new columns (i.e. that are not available at the time you configure the node)
			can be specified as either <i>Enforce exclusion</i> (new columns are excluded and therefore not used for learning) or 
			<i>Enforce inclusion</i> (new columns are included and therefore used for learning).
		</p>
	</option>
      <option name="Enable Hightlighting (#patterns to store)">
        If selected, the node stores the selected number of rows and allows highlighting them in the node view.
      </option>
      <option name="Save target distribution in tree nodes (memory expensive - 
                    only important for tree view and PMML export)">
        If selected, the model stores the distribution of the target category values in each tree node.
        Storing the class distribution may increase memory consumption considerably and we therefore recommend
        disabling it if your use-case doesn't require it.
        Class distribution is only needed if
        <ul>
        	<li>You want to see the class distribution for each tree node in the node view.</li>
        	<li>You want to export individual decision trees to PMML.</li>
        	<li>You want to use soft-voting (i.e. aggregation of probability distributions instead of votes) in the predictor node.</li>
        </ul>
      </option>
      <option name="Split Criterion">Choose the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Formulae">
        split criterion</a> here. Gini is usually a good choice and is used in "Classification and Regression Trees" 
        (Breiman et al, 1984) and the original random forest algorithm (as described by Breiman et al, 2001);
        information gain is used in C4.5; the information gain ratio normalizes the standard information gain by the split
        entropy to overcome any unfair preference for nominal splits with many child nodes.
        </option>
      <option name="Limit number of levels (tree depth)">
        Number of tree levels to be learned. For instance, a value of 1 would only split the (single) root node resulting in a decision stump. 
      </option>
      <option name="Minimum child node size">Minimum number of records in child nodes. In the original paper this is set to 1, which ensures that
      each learned tree fits its training data perfectly (that is if it doesn't contain equivalent rows with differing labels).
      </option>
      <option name="Number of models">
        The number of decision trees to be learned. For most datasets, a value between 100 and 500 yields good results but the optimal number is data dependent
        and should thus be subject to parameter tuning.
      </option>
      <option name="Use static random seed">
        Choose a seed to get reproducible results.
      </option>

  <ports>
    <inPort index="0" name="Input Data">The data to be learned from. They must contain at least one nominal target column and 
      either a fingerprint (bit-vector/byte-vector) column or another numeric or nominal column.
    </inPort>
    <outPort index="0" name="Out-of-bag Predictions">
      The input data with the out-of-bag predictions, i.e. for each input row this is the majority vote of all models that 
      did not use the row during their training. The appended columns are 
      equivalent to the columns appended by the corresponding predictor node. There is one additional column
      <i>model count</i>, which contains the number of models used for the voting (number of models not using the row
      throughout learning.)
      The out-of-bag predictions can be used to get an estimate of the generalization error of the random forest by feeding them into the Scorer node.
    </outPort>
    <outPort index="1" name="Attribute Statistics">
      A statistics table on the attributes used in the different trees. Each row represents one training 
      attribute with these statistics: <i>#splits (level x)</i> as the number of models, which use the attribute as 
      split on level <i>x</i> (with level 0 as root split); <i>#candidates (level x)</i> is the number of times an 
      attribute was in the attribute sample for level <i>x</i> (in a random forest setup these samples differ from
      node to node). If no attribute sampling is used <i>#candidates</i> is the number of models. Note, these numbers 
      are uncorrected, i.e. if an attribute is selected on level 0 but is also in the candidate set of level 1 (but 
      will not be split on level 1 because it has been split one level up), the #candidate number will still count 
      the attribute as candidate.
